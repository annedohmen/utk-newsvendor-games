    <p>
        In this experiment, you have the role of an inventory manager. You must decide how many units of a
        product you want to order and stock to sell to your customers.
    </p>
    <p>
        You are making these decisions over multiple rounds. In each round, you are deciding on an
        order quantity.
    </p>
    <p>
        You are making your decision under uncertainty, 3 months in advance of actual realized demand.
        This means at the time of the order decision you do not know the exact demand of the period. However, you do
        know the probability distribution of the demand of the period you are ordering for, which is 3 months out.
        The demand for your product will be shown by a distribution curve,
        shown on the decision-making page. Demand is independent between rounds.
    </p>
    <p>
        The game will start in January, where the demand for January will be displayed. Because you
        did not order this product, profit from this round will not be shown. You will decide how much
        product you want to order for April (3 months out). The same will happen in February, where
        February demand will be shown, and you will then order for May. This continues until April,
        where demand for April will be shown, your profit from the order you made in January will be
        calculated, and then you will order product for July. This will continue through December, where
        you will make your last ordering decision, to be realized in March of the following year.
   </p>
   <p>
        You have no starting inventory in your warehouse at the beginning of the game. You will order
        units three months in advance, which then get delivered before demand is realized.
        Any leftover inventory after demand is realized will earn a salvage value per unit left over.
    </p>
    <p>
        {# &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; #}
        For example:
        <br>
        <ul>
            <code>
                <li>
                    Purchased inventory: 90 units
                </li>
                <li>
                    Demand: 80 units
                </li>
                <li>
                    Leftover inventory: 90-80=10 units
                </li>
            </code>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        Salvage revenue is earned for the resulting leftover 10 units that are stocked in inventory.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you purchased too few units in a period to fulfill this periodâ€™s demand, the unfulfilled demand is
        lost. You cannot reorder within a period or shift demand to later periods. For example:

        <code>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Purchased inventory: 30 units
                </li>
                <li>
                    Demand: 80 units
                </li>
                <li>
                    Units sold: 30 units
                </li>
            </ul>
        </code>
    </p>
    <p>
        You are trying to maximize your profits in this experiment. Profit per round is calculated as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
        <code class="font-italic">Profit per round = selling price x units sold - purchasing price x order quantity + salvage value * leftover inventory</code>
    </p>
    <p>
        Therefore, profit = revenue - purchase costs + salvage revenue.
    </p>
    <p>
        In this experiment, your costs will be displayed on the decision page.
