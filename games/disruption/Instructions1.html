    <p>
        In this experiment, you have the role of an inventory manager. You must decide how many units of a
        product you want to order and stock to sell to your customers.
    </p>
    <p>
        You are making these decisions over multiple rounds. In each round, you are deciding on an
        order quantity.
    </p>
    <p>
        You are making your decision under uncertainty. This means at the time of the order decision
        you do not know the exact demand of the period. However, you do know the probability
        distribution of the demand. The demand for your product will be shown by a distribution curve,
        shown on the decision-making page. Demand is independent between rounds.
    </p>
    <p>
        You have no starting inventory in your warehouse at the beginning of the game. You will order
        an amount of units between 0 and 1,000 which then get delivered before demand is realized. Any leftover inventory after demand is
        realized will be carried over to the next round, which becomes starting inventory for the next
        period. The starting inventory and order quantity sum up to the available inventory as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
        {# &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; #}
        <code class="ml-4">Available inventory = starting inventory + order quantity</code>
    </p>
    <p>
        Holding costs occur for holding inventory which is carried over between rounds. For example:
        <ul>
            <code>
                <li>
                    Available inventory: 90 units
                </li>
                <li>
                    Demand: 80 units
                </li>
                <li>
                    Leftover inventory: 90 - 80 = 10 units
                </li>
            </code>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        Holding costs are charged for the 10 units leftover in inventory.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you purchased too few units in a period to fulfill this periodâ€™s demand, the unfulfilled demand is lost.
        You cannot reorder within a period or shift demand to later periods. For example:
        <ul>
            <code>
                <li>
                    Available inventory: 30 units
                </li>
                <li>
                    Demand: 80 units
                </li>
                <li>
                    Units sold: 30 units
                </li>
            </code>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        You are trying to maximize your Profits in this experiment. Profit per round is calculated as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
        <code class="ml-4">Profit = sell price x units sold - purchase price x units ordered - holding cost x units leftover</code>
        {# <br><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- purchasing price x units ordered</code> #}
        {# <br><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- holding costs x units leftover</code> #}
    </p>
    <p>
        Therefore, profit = revenue - purchase costs - holding costs.
    </p>
    <p>
        In this experiment, your costs will be displayed on the decision page.
