        <h3 class="page-header">Overview</h3>

        <p>
        This study is designed to better understand demand planner biases. Participants will play two demand planning games at { NUM_PLANNING_PERIODS } rounds per game for a total of { NUM_PLANNING_PERIODS * 2 } rounds. </p>

        <p>
        Each round represents a single planning period, e.g. a single business month. In each game, excess inventory levels of prior planning periods accumulate and are not reset between periods. In each round, you choose the quantity of goods to
        purchase at the start of the period based on your expectations for market demand during the period. At the end of the period, results
        such as cumulative excess inventory levels are computed and stored for later reference as needed to calculate final results at game completion, e.g., cumulative retail, wholesale, holding costs, payoff, etc. </p>

        <p>
        Market demand is simulated each round as a random sample from a statistical distribution . At the start of each game, the planner is randomly assigned
        one of two predefined log-normal distributions which do not change between rounds of the game unless a "demand disruption" occurs, which randomly occurs
        to half of all participats of the study. The distributions are demarcated by significantly different variance magnitudes. As such, the distribution
        assigned to the player will be categorized as either the "low" or the "high" variability distribution. </p>

        <p>
        A chart of the participant's distribution is displayed on the page at all times during the game and does not change during the game, unless a disruption occurs. Statistical
        demand distributions are well-characterized for many markets and therefore should be made available to game participants as similar information is
        expected to be available to industry planners in the course of their real jobs. </p>

        <p>
        On entering the study, participants are randomly assigned one of the following four treatment groups: </p>

        <table id="treatment-table">
            <thead>
                <tr>
                    <th scope="col" colspan="2"></th>
                    <th scope="col" colspan="2">Disrupt Market Demand Distribution<br>during 1<sup>st</sup> Game</th>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <th scope="col" colspan="2"></th>
                    <th scope="col">YES</th>
                    <th scope="col">NO</th>
                </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
                <tr>
                    <th scope="rowgroup" rowspan="2">Market Demand<br>Distribution Variability</th>
                    <th scope="row">HIGH</th>
                    <td>group 1</td>
                    <td>group 2</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <th scope="row">LOW</th>
                    <td>group 3</td>
                    <td>group 4</td>
                </tr>
            </tbody>
            <caption id="table-caption">
                Notes:
                <ul>
                    <li>If the participant should experience a disruption according to their treatment during the 1<sup>st</sup> game, then upon entering period {int(3/4 * NUM_PLANNING_PERIODS)}, the participant's original distribution is replaced with one defined by a different set of parameters. The new distribution is used to draw a random sample of market demand in each planning period remaining in the 1<sup>st</sup> game.
                    </li>
                    <li>In the 2<sup>nd</sup> game, regardless of treatment group, all participants experience a disruption to their market demand distribution upon entering period {int(1/4 * NUM_PLANNING_PERIODS)}.
                    </li>
                </ul>
