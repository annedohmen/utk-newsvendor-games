    <p>
        In this experiment, you have the role of an inventory manager. You must decide how many units of a
        product you want to order and stock to sell them to your customers.
    </p>
    <p>
        You are making these decisions over multiple rounds. In every round, you are deciding on an
        order quantity.
    </p>
    <p>
        You are making your decision under uncertainty, i.e., at the time of the order decision you do
        not know the exact demand of the period. However, you do know the probability distribution of
        the demand. The demand for your product will be show by a distribution curve, shown on the
        decision-making page. Demand is independent between rounds.
    </p>
    <p>
        You have no starting inventory in your warehouse at the beginning of the game. You will order
        units which then get delivered before demand is realized. Any leftover inventory after demand is
        realized will be carried over to the next round (starting inventory). Starting inventory and order
        quantity sum up to the available inventory as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
        {# &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; #}
        <code class="ml-5">available inventory = starting inventory + order quantity</code>
    </p>
    <p>
        Note that you cannot order more than 1,000 units per round.
    </p>
    <p>
        Holding costs occur for holding inventory which is carried over between rounds. E.g., if your
        available inventory is 90 units but demand is only 80 units, you can only 80 sell units (because
        demand was only 80). The left-over 10 units are stocked in inventory and holding costs are
        charged for these. Holding costs are charged for the resulting left-over 10 units that are stocked
        in inventory. If you purchased too few units in a period to fulfill this period’s demand, the
        unfulfilled demand is lost. You cannot reorder within a period or shift demand to later periods.
        E.g., if your available inventory is only 30 units and demand is 80 units, you can only sell 30
        units (since you did not order more).
    </p>
    <p>
        You are trying to maximize your Cash Flow (CF) in this experiment. The CF is calculated as
        follows:
    </p>
    <p>
        <code class="ml-5">CF = Selling price x units sold - purchasing price x order quantity – holding costs * holding inventory</code>
    </p>
    <p>
        Note that the units sold is the minimum of demand and available inventory. You receive the
        selling price for every unit sold. From this amount, you need to deduct the purchasing costs for
        the products bought. Additionally, you need to deduct the holding costs for the holding
        inventory.
    </p>
    <p>
        In this experiment, your costs will be displayed on the decision page.
