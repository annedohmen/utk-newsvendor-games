        <br>
        <br>
        <center>
            <img src="{{ static instructions_demand_page_1 }}" width="1100" height="817" />  <!-- 689 × 512, ratio=0.7431 -->
            <br>
            <br>
            <img src="{{ static instructions_demand_page_2 }}" width="1100" height="1036" />  <!-- 637 × 600, ratio=0.9419 -->
        </center>
    </p>
    <p class="mt-5">
        At the bottom, there is a place for you to input how much you want to order for the next round:

        <center>
            <img src="{{ static instructions_demand_page_3 }}" width="1100" height="540" />  <!-- 697x342, ratio=0.4907 -->
        </center>
    </p>
    <p class="mt-5">
        Bonus pay will be calculated by multiplying profit from one round by .75%. For example, a single round profit of $4,000 would lead to a bonus pay of 4,000*.00075= $3.  This pay will be added to your account in the next week.
    </p>
    <p>
        At the end of the game, there will be a code to input into Prolific to get the base pay. Make sure you copy the code from this page before exiting out of the game.
