        This study has two games. Each game consists of {{ Constants.num_rounds }} planning periods. Game 1 will start when you click the Next button (below). Total profit is
        reported after completing the game and its resulting magnitude depends mainly on the difference
        between your chosen order quantity and observed (or simulated) demand quantity averaged over the 24
        planning periods. Each Market demand is simulated by drawing a single random samples by a known statistical distribution that remains constant
        throughout the game. That is, the parameters distribution  used to model market demand (defined by parameters drives
        simulated levels of demand during the game where quantity demanded is revealed during the round by
        randomly selecting one sample from the distribution. A visualization of this distribution is continuously
        and clearly displayed on each page during the game as a convenience visual aid to the participants.
        Part 2's instructions will be provided upon completing Part 1.
